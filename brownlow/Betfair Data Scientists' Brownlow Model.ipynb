    "I have a strong feeling that past performance may be a predictor of future performance in the brownlow. For example, last year Dusty Martin won the Brownlow. The umpires may have a bias towards Dusty this year because he is known to be on their radar as being a good player. Let's create a feature which is categorical and is 1 if the player has previously finished in the top 10. Let's create a function for this and then apply it to the afltables dataset, which has data back to 1897. We will then create a lookup table for the top 10 for each season and merge this table with our current features df."

    "### Historic Performance Relative To Model Feature\n",
    "It is well known that some players are good Brownlow performers. For whatever reason, they always poll much better than their stats may suggest. Lance Franklin and Bontempelli are probably in this category. Perhaps these players have an X-factor that Machine Learning models struggle to pick up on. To get around this, let's create a feature which looks at the player's performance relative to the model's prediction. To do this, we'll need to train and predict 7 different models - from 2011 to 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a model for each season, we will use h2o's AutoML. If you're new to h2o, please read about it [here.](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html) It can be used in both R and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric we will use for loss in Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are using regression, some values are negative. We will convert these negative values to 0 as it doesn't make sense to poll negative brownlow votes. Similarly, some matches won't predict exactly 6 votes, so we will scale these predictions so that we predict exactly 6 votes for each match.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that you don't have to train these models yourself, I have saved the models and we will load them in. If you are keen to train the models yourself, simply uncomment out the code below and run the cell. To bulk uncomment, highlight the rows and press ctrl + '/'"

Again, rather than waiting for the model to train, I will save the model so you can simply load it in. We will also scale our features. We can then see how our model went in predicting last year's brownlow, creating a baseline for this years' predictions. We will then predict this year's vote count."
